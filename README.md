# Implementation of Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm

## Introduction

An implementation practice to learn how decision tree, gradient boosting tree and hierarchical clustering works.

The implementation of the three algorithms are in `DecisionTreeRegressor.py`, `GradientBoostingRegressor.py` and `Clustering.py` respectively.

## Dependencies

* numpy

## Note

This is the solution for the assignment of the master-level data mining course in NUS.
